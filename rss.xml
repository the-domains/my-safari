            <description><![CDATA[<p> You can rewind, you can fast forward, you can go to the bits that you missed, you can go to the bits that are most important. It's a lasting piece of work that anyone can go to at any point. Reading a document is one thing, but actually seeing it put into practice in everyday situations, you can't really do better than that. Sam Gibson Speech Pathologist</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>The video is wonderful, because you can actually SEE! It's a lot easier visually to find out the best way to manage a person with certain behaviours than it is to read it. Face to face, living with a person is much better than a written format.
