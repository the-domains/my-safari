We here at SafariGo take great pride in being the supreme specialists when it comes to organising Youth Workshops and Events. We firmly believe the youth of today hold the key to unlock a better and brighter future for our planet, and our motto CREATE -- INSPIRE -- EDUCATE is the driving force behind the programs we design. SafariGo produces innovative Youth events for the 12-16 year old bracket, clocking into contemporary culture to engage and motivate acute, brilliant young minds. The best way to nurture life skills, growth and development is to disguise the lessons in a giant package of fun, and SafariGo are masters of that!Some of our past projects have included Youth Week activities and events, Multicultural Youth festivals, Music DJ and Dance workshops, and Art/Graffiti sessions. Our clients range from liaising with local councils, to charity and not-for-profit organisations, to school groups, and private companies, and the feedback is consistently amazing. In fact, check out the video below and see for yourself! SafariGO gives personalised service from the first seeds of conception, helping to guide your vision (and offering heaps of creative input!) right through the process, organising the mass preparation, and culminating in facilitating the actual workshop or event. We aim to connect by inspiring the mind and setting alight the spirit of Youth, and the results have been nothing short of astounding.Our team would love to be involved in making your next Youth Workshop or Event a roaring success. Whatever the task, whatever the budget, SafariGo will tackle any challenge and produce an experience with memories that live on long after the actual date.
